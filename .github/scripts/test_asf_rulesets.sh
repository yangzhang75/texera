# Invariants over the CI configuration that a plain YAML parse cannot see.
#
# 1. "Merge Queue" and "Merge Queue (release)" in .asf.yaml must carry
#    identical rules: they are one policy split across two rulesets only so
#    the release half can hold an Actions bypass that must not reach main.
#    Nothing else keeps the copies from drifting apart.
# 2. .asf.yaml and every workflow must parse with a duplicate-key-strict
#    loader. PyYAML silently keeps the last duplicate, but GitHub's loader
#    rejects the file, so a duplicated trigger key passes local checks and
#    then stops the workflow from ever starting.
