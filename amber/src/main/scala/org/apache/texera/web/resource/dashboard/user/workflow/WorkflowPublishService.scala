/**
  * Version pinning for public workflows.
  *
  * A public workflow follows the author's latest, as publishing has always done, until the author
  * pins the version they have now: the public then keeps seeing that frozen copy while the author's
  * later edits stay in the workflow's own columns until they pin again.
  *
  * `is_public` stays the on/off switch; `published_content` is the pin, NULL while following. A pin
  * freezes everything on public show -- the graph, the title, the description and the view it opens
  * in -- because a copy that froze only its graph would still advertise a title nobody published.
  *
  * Not to be confused with sharing: a user granted access always tracks the author's latest, pin or
  * no pin. Only viewers who arrive because the workflow is public are held at the frozen copy.
